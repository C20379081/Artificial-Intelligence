I will explore the efficacy of different search algorithms in several different maze environments. I will be outlining the parameters for two mazes and testing the depth first search (DFS), Iterative depth search and the A* search algorithm on these mazes to see how they perform. 

I will be using the 2 mazes below to test the efficiency of the algorithms.

See the docuent for more detail on the setup and implementation
